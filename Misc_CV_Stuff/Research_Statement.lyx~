\begin_layout Title
Research Statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Hien Duy Nguyen
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My core research program can be broken up into three key areas: mathematical
 statistics, computational statistics, and applied statistics.
 I will discuss in detail my achievements and progress in each of the three
 topics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Mathematical Statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My primary work in mathematical statistics revolve around the asymptotic
 theory of estimators and the approximation capabilities of important functional
 classes in statistics, such as the class of convex combinations of certain
 families of density functions, or finite mixture models, for the uniform
 approximation of more general classes probability densities.
 My publications in this direction of research include the articles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2018af,Nguyen:2018ai,Nguyen:2019aa,Nguyen:2019ac"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2018af"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, my coauthors (which will now be taken as an understood acknowledgement
 when referring to joint work) and I demonstrate how the class of mixtures
 of triangular distributions can be used to arbitrarily approximate any
 twice-differentiable density function on the unit interval.
 In this paper, I prove both an approximation rate under which uniform approxima
tion occurs, as well as a convergence rate regarding the maximum likelihood
 estimator of such a mixture models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2019aa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we provide a literature review of the current state of the affairs regarding
 the estimation and approximation rate of the maximum likelihood estimator
 for general location-scale finite mixture models.
 The results in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2018ai"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 provides a convergence result regarding the use of finite mixture models
 with randomized parameters for density estimation on a convex domain.
 Finally, and most significantly, my PhD student and I, along with esteemed
 coauthors, were able to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{p}$
\end_inset

 approximation results for 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in\left[1,\infty\right]$
\end_inset

 regarding the use of finite mixtures of continuous densities that are vanishing
 at infinity.
 Our results are more general than those previously reported in the literature,
 and have powerful features, such as allowing for approximation of densities
 on non-compact domains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are still a number of significant open problems that stem from this
 research path.
 Firstly, we are still investigating whether there are weaker conditions
 than those that we have imposed that lead to uniform and 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{p}$
\end_inset

 approximation results.
 Secondly, we are investigating whether there are simpler proof methods
 than the convolution and Riemann integration techniques that we have used
 in our previous results.
 And thirdly, we seek weak conditions under which we may establish rates
 of convergence of our constructed classes for use when estimating density
 functions from data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the works above, regarding the use approximation capabilities
 of finite mixture models, I am also actively investigating the use of mixtures
 of experts for functional approximation.
 To this end, I have used the famous Stone-Weierstrass theorem to obtain
 results regarding the approximation capabilities of the mean functional
 of mixture of experts models for both univariate and multivariate approximation
, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2016aaa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2019aca"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, respectively.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2019aca"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we also established conditions under which approximation in Kullback-Leibler
 divergence regarding conditional densities could be established.
 Further work in this direction will revolve around the establishment of
 approximation and estimation rates of certain classes of mixture of experts
 models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding more general estimation theory, I have made some contributions
 towards the study of divide-and-conquer type estimators, when data are
 not independent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2018ag"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 I have also been keenly interested in the study of maximum pseudolikelihood
 estimators (MPLEs).
 For example, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2018aaa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I provided a general result regarding the consistency of the MPLE for
 discrete data generating processes.
 A specific study of the asymptotic normality of the so-called fully visible
 Boltzmann machine (FVBM) was conducted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2016ae"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A characterization of an autoregressive mixture of Laplace distributions
 is provided along with MPLE theorems in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2016ah"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, and an asymptotic normality result regarding feasible least squares of
 an autocorrelated linear model is established in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2019ad"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Miscellaneously, I established some new results regarding an interesting
 maximum likelihood problem regarding the triangle distribution in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2017ac"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Here, I investigated an interesting phenomenon regarding the expected time
 complexity for the maximum likelihood estimator of the triangle distribution.
 I have also made some exploration of the concept of strict sub-Gaussianity
 for bounded random variables in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Arbel:2019aa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Computational Statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The majority of my work in computational statistics stems from my PhD studies,
 which was primarily on the estimation of finite mixture models and regression
 variants of such models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2015ab"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, my work focuses on the development of EM (expectation–maximizati
on) and MM (majorization/minorization–minimization/maximization) type algorithms
 for such models, and beyond.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding finite mixture models, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2015aaa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I developed a new EM algorithm for the popular multivariate normal mixture
 model.
 Using MM algorithm techniques for optimization of non-differentiable objectives
, I proposed a method for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of mixtures
 of triangle distributions in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2016ad"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2016ac"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I proposed a method for using mixture models in order to draw non-parametric
 inference regarding linear mixed effects models, where one cannot make
 assumptions regarding the random effect distribution, other than symmetry.
 Mixtures of linear mixed effects models were further considered for the
 purpose of classification and clustering of bivariate functional data in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2016aj"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A novel MM algorithm for estimation of LASSO penalized mixtures of linear
 regression models was proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lloyd-Jones:2018aa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Further work in this direction includes the exploration of generalized
 linear model constructions as well as the investigation of asymptotic and
 finite sample results regarding the nature of penalized mixture regression
 models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For time series clustering and classification, I further proposed two the
 use of mixtures of autoregressive models, estimated using MM algorithms.
 The papers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2016ag"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2017af"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 are variations on this theme, which utilized different pseudolikelihood
 constructions for the characterization of the estimation objective.
 Both sets of results have been successfully applied to the clustering and
 classification of time series data that arise in neuroscience.
 In the future, this work can be expanded to take into account inter class
 variation via random effects as well as time series constructions other
 than autoregressive models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to finite mixture of regression models are their generalization,
 the class of mixtures of experts.
 On this front, I proposed an MM algorithm for the MLE of the mixture of
 Laplace experts model, as well as investigated its robustness properties
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2016ai"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 My further work in mixture of experts modeling are reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2018aba"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chamroukhi:2019aa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Mixture of experts models are an important probabilistic neural network
 and understand and estimating them will only become more important in the
 current era of deep network architectures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from mixture models applications, I have also made numerous research
 contributions to the study of EM and MM algorithms, more generally.
 For example, I have contributed the following tutorial paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2017ab"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 regarding the use of MM algorithms.
 An application of the MM algorithm framework towards the problem of fitting
 FVBM appears in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2016af"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 MM algorithms for some support vector machine (SVM) variants were proposed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2017ad"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, and an MM algorithm for the estimation of heteroskedastic regression models
 was considered in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2016ab"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The need for stochastic approximation optimization algorithms in order to
 handle estimation problems pertaining to large data sets is an important
 consideration of modern statistical analysis.
 Towards this direction, I have contributed a stochastic approximation algorithm
 for the MLE of a subclass of normal mixture models in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2018ac"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Stochastic MM algorithms for the estimation of some SVM variants were considere
d in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2018ad"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Recently, I studied the use of a stochastic EM algorithm for the mini-batch
 estimation of normal mixture models in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2019ab"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This area of research is an important one and I hope to make further contributi
ons towards the derivation and understanding of stochastic approximation
 type algorithms, when applied to non-convex and non-smooth estimation problems
 in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Importantly, I believe that statistical methods should be made easily available,
 as to best benefit the scientific community.
 To this end, I have been diligent in making novel methodology available
 via software implementations, specifically in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{R}$
\end_inset

 statistical language.
 For example, I have coauthored the packages 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{BoltzMM}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{logKDE}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{lowmemtkmeans}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{SAGMM}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{SSOSVM}$
\end_inset

, that are all available on the comprehensive 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{R}$
\end_inset

 archive network (CRAN).
 Furthermore, I believe that it is important that software adhere to community
 standards, such as those set out by the Journal of Open Source Software.
 Thus, I have also strived to prepare my software to meet these more stringent
 goals.
 Example of such preparation are my 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{R}$
\end_inset

 packages that are detailed in

\begin_layout Section*
Applied Statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides my computational and mathematical work, I have also endeavored to
 engage with the scientific community, via applied work that are both primary
 and consultative in nature.
 The first example of my applied work are towards the better understanding
 of proteomics experiments via distribution-robust permutation testing methodolo
gy that are constructed specifically for the data type.
 My work in this direction includes the descriptive articles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2012aa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2017ae"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, as well as the development of a web application for the application of
 such methodology in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chen:2014aa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further works regarding hypothesis testing are those that are applied to
 the various false discovery rate (FDR) control problems in neuroscience.
 Here, I provided a framework for model-based FDR control, under spatial
 correlation for structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2014ab"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 I further suggest a method for FDR control of quantized data, which are
 common in MRI studies, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2019aba"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Another work relating to the analysis of brain imaging data is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Orban:2018aa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which considers the problem of generalizability of machine learning studies
 between different imaging cohorts.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen:2018ah"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I also considered the application of mixture models to the problem of
 clustering time series data that arise from calcium imaging studies of
 zebrafish.
 Further research in this direction has been rapid, as I am currently collaborat
ing with multiple neuroscience groups regarding both human imaging problems
 as well as problems that arise from the study of animal models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have also actively collaborated on research in fishery science.
 For example, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lloyd-Jones:2014aa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I helped in characterizing a random effects model that lead to the improved
 estimation of size transition matrices of aquatic species that are sampled
 via catch–recapture studies.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lloyd-Jones:2016aa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I contributed to the study of multigenerational data arising form crab
 fisheries studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other works, I have for instance to the analysis of Australian political
 science data using FVBMs in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bagnall:2018aa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 I have also consulted on various applied problems such as towards the study
 chemical pathways via proteomics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Inder:2012aa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the analysis of behavioral economics experiments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Oyarzun:2017aa"

\end_inset

, and the study of pedestrian safety for accident prevention 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Truong:2019aa"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 I believe that a part of doing good statistics is to appreciate the plethora
 of available problems that can be studied through the statistical lens.
 As such, I am always open and welcoming of new and interesting applied
 projects.
